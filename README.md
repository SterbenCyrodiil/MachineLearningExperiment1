# MachineLearningExperiment1
A small personal project I'm doing in my free time. Not that I have much of that these days. 

Purpose is to test and play around the following techologies:
Java OOP;
Node.JS+Express.JS;
React;
H2O (Machine Learning);

The main objective is that this Experiment will be able to predict, based on certain traits, which specific products a certain user will prefer.
For example, it is likely that people with the same age and similar socio-economical conditions will purchase and access similar products.
